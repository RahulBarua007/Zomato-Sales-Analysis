A Zomato Sales Analysis project in Power BI involves creating an interactive dashboard to visualize and analyze sales data from Zomato. The project would typically include key metrics such as total sales, average order value, popular cuisines, customer demographics, and geographical distribution of orders. The dashboard allows users to filter data by time periods, locations, and other dimensions, providing insights into sales trends, top-performing restaurants, and customer preferences. This project helps stakeholders make data-driven decisions to optimize sales strategies and improve customer satisfaction.
